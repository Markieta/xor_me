== Usage for doc files ==

Get key/hash values for a given doc file.

$ ./xor_doc some.doc
Could be a XOR-ciphered doc file.
nKey  d10d
nHash cc1f

Try some password on this file.

$ ./xor_me toto 0xd10d 0Xcc1f
Key: d10d
Hash: cc1f
FAIL! toto

Try the good password on this file.

$ ./xor_me 0824 0xd10d 0Xcc1f
Key: d10d
Hash: cc1f
Good guess: 0824

== Usage for xls files ==

Get key/hash values for a given xls file.

$ ./xor_xls some.xls
Bored by reading the specs... Just pick up a XOR encryption pattern
Record type FilePass with 2F 00.
followed by 00 06 for size.
followed by 00 00 for wEncryptionType XOR.
followed by what you want: 2 bytes for key, 2 bytes for hash.
WARNING: little endian, you should permute bytes
00000210  06 03 00 00 86 00 00 00  2f 00 06 00 00 00 9a 49  |......../......I|
00000220  61 cc e1 00 02 00 b0 04  c1 00 02 00 ca a4 e2 00  |a...............|

Try some password on this file.

$ ./xor_me 4242 0x499a 0Xcc61
Key: 499a
Hash: cc61
FAIL! 4242

Try the good password on this file.

$ ./xor_me 1950 0x499a 0Xcc61
Key: 499a
Hash: cc61
Good guess: 1950

== Bruteforcing the password ==

$ ./brute_force 0x499a 0xcc61
Key: 499a
Hash: cc61
  20
    20
      20
Password: '1950'

It is limited to password with up to 8 chars. It works well for short
password and can take several hours for password with 7 or 8 chars.

== Limitations ==

Only XOR, only XLS, only DOC. Nothing more nothing less.
